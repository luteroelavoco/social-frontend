# Frontend Project: Next.js 13 with TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and Vercel.

## Introduction

This project is a Frontend application built using Next.js 13 with TypeScript. It incorporates ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and consistency. The application is deployed on Vercel, a cloud platform optimized for frontend projects.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in the project root:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
```

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

The frontend server will be up and running on http://localhost:3000.

## TypeScript and Next.js
The project uses TypeScript in combination with Next.js, a popular React framework that offers server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and other features for building efficient and high-performance applications.

## ESLint and Prettier
ESLint and Prettier are used to ensure consistent code quality and formatting throughout the project. ESLint helps identify and fix problematic patterns, while Prettier automatically formats the code according to predefined rules.

## Deploy on Vercel
The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the Vercel Platform from the creators of Next.js.

To deploy your frontend project on Vercel, follow these general steps:

1. Sign up for a Vercel account if you don't have one.
2. Install the Vercel CLI on your machine.
```bash
npm install -g vercel
# or
yarn global add vercel
# or
pnpm add -g vercel
```
3. Navigate to your project directory and run the Vercel deployment command:
```bash
vercel
```

Follow the prompts and provide any necessary information during the deployment process.
Once the deployment is complete, you will receive a URL where your frontend application is accessible.
For more detailed instructions on deploying a Next.js application on Vercel, refer to the Vercel documentation.
